Dec 06 19:42:26 <jstnn>	it's the last thing I need to get working before I can call this laptop "done", driving me nuts
Dec 06 19:43:55 <jstnn>	xrandr --set audio on doesn't throw errors but doesn't make the sound go over there either
Dec 06 19:47:17 <Veyrdite>	jstnn: Audio is handled either by alsa directly or via pulseaudio (if you have it installed)
Dec 06 19:47:27 <Veyrdite>	For the plain alsa route: you need to tell mpv to use a different output device
Dec 06 19:47:41 <Veyrdite>	eg on my laptop it's mpv --audio-device=alsa/hdmi
Dec 06 19:47:52 <Veyrdite>	Alternatively you can edit .asoundrc to change the defaults for all applications
Dec 06 19:47:57 <Veyrdite>	Overall it's not a great experience
Dec 06 19:48:18 <Veyrdite>	Pulseaudio provide easier ways to solve this, but it adds latency and can cause other issues (in my experiences), so I personally avoid it.  Opinions vary.
Dec 06 19:48:48 <Veyrdite>	Most user-friendly distros go the pulseaudio route and provide a GUI to redirecty audio.  Whether or not pulse does this automatically for you when you attach an HDMI cable depends on a lot of things.

I use this laptop on several different desks with different monitor setups so I have a handful of alias that do all the xrandr shit. I just plug it in and type 'tv' or 'office' or 'bedroom' or whatever and it goes. Ideally I'd just like to be able to add another command to a couple of those that says "hey send all the audio over there"
Dec 06 19:51:35 <jstnn>	I have pulseaudio installed, I just followed the post-installation stuff on the wiki
Dec 06 19:52:28 <jstnn>	pulseaudio, alsa-utils are installed
Dec 06 19:57:45 <Veyrdite>	I've only ever used GUI tools for pulseaudio.  Not sure of the name, they come with DE's
Dec 06 19:57:56 <Veyrdite>	Try the Arch Linux wiki pages on pulseaudio
Dec 06 19:58:45 <jstnn>	Yeah I'm looking there now, would really prefer a cli solution since I'm not using a DE in the first place.
Dec 06 19:59:15 <Veyrdite>	If you jettison pulseaudio: changing the default output device in .asoundrc (when you run your 'tv', 'office', etc commands) is the other option.
Dec 06 19:59:17 <dTal>	pulseaudio is not CLI friendly
Dec 06 20:01:19 <dTal>	it's from the modern school of development where command line programs are expected to mostly be called by other programs, and helpful messages and comfortable interfaces are optional
Dec 06 20:01:38 <dTal>	exhibit a, try calling pactl with no arguments
Dec 06 20:02:45 <dTal>	does it do something useful, like display status, version, a list of valid commands, or any other helpful hint? Hell no! just "No valid command specified"
Dec 06 20:08:01 <jstnn>	fun
Dec 06 20:08:36 <blackbeard420>	pulsemixer is a nice cli
Dec 06 20:08:56 <jstnn>	Yeah the Archwiki had some promising stuff (I did identify the device and can play arbitrary sounds through it with aplay) but no dice other than that.

Dec 06 20:10:56 <maxice8[m]>	dTal: the pactl exit sounds fair
Dec 06 20:11:46 <Veyrdite>	dTal: Many cli tools are like that.  gcc, for instance.  Then there are the tools that do "bad things" to new players if they run them without args: cat, vim
Dec 06 20:11:59 <Veyrdite>	As much as I dislike pulse, I don't think they're any different on that point

Dec 11 08:08:01 <unmy>	anyone using: export CHROME_FLAGS="blablabla" to set up some stuff? because chromium ignoring that and Im not sure when it started doing it

Dec 11 08:13:18 <maxice8[m]>	yes
Dec 11 08:13:24 <maxice8[m]>	see the /usr/bin/chromium wrapper
Dec 11 08:13:32 <maxice8[m]>	guess we have to take into account user flags
Dec 11 08:19:07 <adema>	also, i haven't had time to understand why, but since a few weeks, if i do not remove the ~/.local/chromium, it won't start
Dec 11 08:19:32 <adema>	Well, process will actually start, but do nothing and hang in the background
Dec 11 08:21:14 <unmy>	gpu rasterization without other tweaks was abble to hang my gpu
Dec 11 08:22:12 *	Neel is now known as dx_ob
Dec 11 08:32:32 <unmy>	maxice8[m], thanks I added to /usr/bin/chromium CHROME_FLAGS="$CHROME_FLAGS --enable-gpu-rasterization" and working fine now
Dec 11 08:35:39 <maxice8[m]>	unmy:  should be after so the user can override it, a small oversight
Dec 11 08:35:57 <maxice8[m]>	sadly bumping chromium is super costly
Dec 11 08:38:36 <unmy>	ah ye true but still it can be overwriten if set this up by chrome://flags
Dec 11 08:40:24 <unmy>	bumping to change simple shell file in package and block builders for half day :D

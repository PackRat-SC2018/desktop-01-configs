Feb 18 18:08:51 <raindev>	Hm, 20191109/ is the most recent directory to have a signature file
Feb 18 18:13:53 <raindev>	As well as a signing key: https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/tree/master/srcpkgs/void-release-keys/files/
Feb 18 18:14:35 <raindev>	I guess, 20191109 is the most recent one intended to be used then
Feb 18 18:18:54 *	tuy360 (~tuy360@d118-75-245-169.try.wideopenwest.com) has joined
Feb 18 18:19:27 <maldridge>	indeed
Feb 18 18:19:36 <maldridge>	it contains the most recent qualified images
Feb 18 18:20:40 *	tuy360 has quit (Client Quit)
Feb 18 18:21:10 <ericonr>	raindev: if you want to be cool and hip though, you can help me test out the new ones :p
Feb 18 18:22:40 <raindev>	maldridge: thanks for confirming. What's the purpose of the newer images that are available?
Feb 18 18:23:03 <ericonr>	20201224 will be scrapped
Feb 18 18:23:19 <ericonr>	2021* will be signed and released once tested
Feb 18 18:23:44 <raindev>	ericonr: I'd be happy to help :)
Feb 18 18:24:57 <raindev>	Are there any docs on the topic?
Feb 18 18:25:13 <raindev>	Or some automated tests?
Feb 18 18:27:49 <ericonr>	raindev: not really. testing images in this case is going through installs with them :p
Feb 18 18:28:20 <ericonr>	though I guess we could also automate virtualized tests at some point
Feb 18 18:28:26 <heliocat>	woops
Feb 18 18:28:31 <heliocat>	https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/ctypes-buffer-overflow-pycarg_repr.html
Feb 18 18:29:09 <raindev>	ericonr: Got it :) Anything in specific you want me to pay attention to or a particular platform you're interested in?
Feb 18 18:30:11 <ericonr>	not sure, sorry
Feb 18 18:30:32 <ericonr>	though picking a graphical image is a good way of flexing themm
Feb 18 18:30:52 <raindev>	No problem, I could go over the installation process, play around and take notes
Feb 18 18:30:55 <ericonr>	heliocat: grr bad commit message, if it's the one from hackernews today
Feb 18 18:31:40 <heliocat>	dunno, a buddy dropped that in another irc channel
Feb 18 18:31:41 <raindev>	ericonr: how do I verify the images though? :P
Feb 18 18:33:35 <fuselage>	got the script modified to my liking

Feb 18 18:34:01 <murmeli_>	fuselage: maybe my modified version (with comments) helps: http://ix.io/2PUy/bash (note the -p option)

Feb 18 18:43:46 <fuselage>	tks murmeli_ . will look
Feb 18 18:45:46 <raindev>	Is alpha.de an official mirror maintained by someone from the team?
Feb 18 18:46:21 <raindev>	Positive, just found that in the docs
Feb 18 18:47:05 <raindev>	ericonr: sounds good ;)
Feb 18 18:47:11 <heliocat>	yes, that's the master repo
Feb 18 18:48:50 <maldridge>	strictly alpha.hel is the root mirror
Feb 18 18:49:03 <maldridge>	alpha.de is an alias that I'll probably never be able to kill off
Feb 18 18:50:05 <heliocat>	enshrined in api land forever
Feb 18 18:52:47 <heliocat>	anyway, raindev alpha in this case means "first" not "unstable bullshit"

T 1544143346 18<jstnn18>	it's the last thing I need to get working before I can call this laptop "done", driving me nuts
T 1544143435 18<jstnn18>	xrandr --set audio on doesn't throw errors but doesn't make the sound go over there either
T 1544143637 18<Veyrdite18>	jstnn: Audio is handled either by alsa directly or via pulseaudio (if you have it installed)
T 1544143647 18<Veyrdite18>	For the plain alsa route: you need to tell mpv to use a different output device
T 1544143661 18<Veyrdite18>	eg on my laptop it's mpv --audio-device=alsa/hdmi
T 1544143672 18<Veyrdite18>	Alternatively you can edit .asoundrc to change the defaults for all applications
T 1544143677 18<Veyrdite18>	Overall it's not a great experience
T 1544143698 18<Veyrdite18>	Pulseaudio provide easier ways to solve this, but it adds latency and can cause other issues (in my experiences), so I personally avoid it.  Opinions vary.
T 1544143728 18<Veyrdite18>	Most user-friendly distros go the pulseaudio route and provide a GUI to redirecty audio.  Whether or not pulse does this automatically for you when you attach an HDMI cable depends on a lot of things.

I use this laptop on several different desks with different monitor setups so I have a handful of alias that do all the xrandr shit. I just plug it in and type 'tv' or 'office' or 'bedroom' or whatever and it goes.

T 1544144276 18<Veyrdite18>	Try the Arch Linux wiki pages on pulseaudio
T 1544144325 18<jstnn18>	Yeah I'm looking there now, would really prefer a cli solution since I'm not using a DE in the first place.
T 1544144355 18<Veyrdite18>	If you jettison pulseaudio: changing the default output device in .asoundrc (when you run your 'tv', 'office', etc commands) is the other option.
T 1544144357 18<dTal18>	pulseaudio is not CLI friendly
T 1544144479 18<dTal18>	it's from the modern school of development where command line programs are expected to mostly be called by other programs, and helpful messages and comfortable interfaces are optional

T 1544144565 18<dTal18>	does it do something useful, like display status, version, a list of valid commands, or any other helpful hint? Hell no! just "No valid command specified"
